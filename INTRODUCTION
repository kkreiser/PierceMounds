Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is an increasingly useful method of remote sensing used by archaeologists to help gather 
information on the environment of a region. The process involves attaching a camera to the bottom of an aerial vehicle to gather 
images of the ground. From this aerial imagery we can adjust the data to focus and enhance different features of the natural
environment. Archaeologists could be looking for historic homesteads or foundations, old field furrows, mounds, or other earthworks
and this aerial imagery is a great way to efficiently analyze a large area to find these ground anomalies. LiDAR is also incredibly
useful because researchers are able to survey areas that may be incredibly difficult to examine by foot, like dense forests or wetlands. 
With a little bit of editing within a remote sensing program vegetation can be edited out, leaving a clear view of the ground. 
Today, we wanted to look at one particular site in northwest Florida, Pierce Mounds. While this is a known site, we hope showing it 
with LiDAR will emphasize the utility of such a tool. The site itself is covered by dense vegetation and is impossible to see from
standard satellite imagery (Figure 1). From the ground, most of the mounds at the site are easy to recognize, but sometimes another
angle can also help us find something new.
