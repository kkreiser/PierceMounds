# WHAT IS REMOTE SENSING?
- Remote sinsing is using technology to to remotely find and study the enviornment.
- LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is one way to gather aerial images of the landscape.
- We can use remote sensing to gather information from large areas that may be difficult to study from the ground.
- Archaeologists can use remote sensing and LiDAR to find historic homesteads or foundations, old field furrows, mounds, or other earthworks.
- When studying aerial data things like vegetation or buildings can be removed so we can see the ground clearly.


# OUR PROJECT
- We want to look at one particular archaeological site in northwest Florida. 
- The site is already known, but is hidden away in a densely vegetated area just south of a wetland on private property. 
- With LiDAR we can take a look at the area to check on the site, to make sure nothing has affected it.
